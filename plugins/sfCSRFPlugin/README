= sfCSRF plugin =

The `sfCSRFPlugin` plugin provides protection against Cross Site Request Forgeries (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Csrf).

This plugin is a backport of a symfony 1.1 native feature.

== Installation ==

  * Install the plugin
  
  {{{
    symfony plugin-install http://plugins.symfony-project.com/sfCSRFPlugin
  }}}

  * Enable the plugin in `filters.yml` and choose a secret

  {{{
    csrf:
      class: sfCSRFFilter
      param:
        secret: my$ecret
  }}}

  * Clear you cache

  {{{
    symfony cc
  }}}

=== Usage ===

As soon as you enable the plugin in your `filters.yml` configuration file, you are protected against CSRF attacks.

=== How does it work? ===

The CSRF filter automatically adds a hidden field called `_csrf_token` for every form before the response is sent to the browser. The token value is made of the user `session_id` and the `secret` you have configured in the `filters.yml` file.

When a form is submitted in `POST`, the CSRF filter checks for the token value. If the token is not present or if the value is not the excepted one, the plugin send a `sfException` exception.
